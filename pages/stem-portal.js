              The Dr. Frederick S. Humphries STEAM Portal
            </h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the Dr. Frederick S. Humphries STEAM Portal (STEAM
              Portal). We created the portal to be a resource to help us address
              the lack of significant numbers of BIPOC students pursuing careers
              in STEAM disciplines, and the reluctance of boys of color, in
              particular, to pursue STEAM careers resulting from a lack of
              preparation, confidence, resources, and supports.
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the inequities in public
              education, and how equitable opportunities are so dependent upon
              parental background, wealth, and access to resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              The George Floyd killing (and others since) has also laid bare how
              institutional racism and an anti- Black sentiment create major
              obstacles in the path of a Black boy seeking to excel academically
              and join the ranks of the successful.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the effects of systemic racism and exclusion from
              educational and professional opportunities have prevented
              significant numbers of otherwise qualified BIPOC students from
              pursuing careers in STEAM disciplines, and contributed to the
              resulting devastation and disproportionate BIPOC statistics due to
              COVID-19, the educational journey of many who would be STEAM
              professionals often begins in the poorly-performing public schools
              of under- resourced communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              They’re rarely prepared for the mental, emotional, and financial
              challenges ahead. The STEAM Portal seeks to address this problem
              by providing a comprehensive, evidence and equity-based support
              system for this target group as well as information on STEAM
              career-path activities and opportunities at Historically Black
              Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs).
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re honored to associate our STEAM Portal with Dr. Frederick S.
              Humphries. An academic administrator and chemistry professor who
              has been a Regent Professor at the Florida A&amp;M University
              College of Law, President Emeritus of Tennessee State University
              (1974 to 1985), and President Emeritus of Florida A&amp;M
              University (1985 to 2001), Dr. Humphries earned a bachelor&#39;s
              degree in physical chemistry from Florida A&amp;M University,
              where he graduated magna cum laude in 1957.
            </p>
            <p>
              He received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of
              Pittsburgh in 1964 where he was the first African American to
              receive a Ph.D. in this discipline from Pitt.
            </p>
            <p>
              During his tenure at Florida A&amp;M, the school attracted 657
              National Achievement Scholars and surpassed such universities as
              Harvard, Yale and Stanford to lead the nation in numbers of
              National Achievement Scholars in 1992, 1995, and 1997, tying with
              Harvard in 2000. The focus on high-achieving students led to a
              tenfold increase in science and engineering students, with a
              corresponding increase at the master&#39;s degree level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doctoral degree programs increased from one in 1985 to ten in
              2000. The FAMU Industry Cluster (comprising 152 major
              corporations) and the Life-Gets-Better Scholarship program,
              sponsored by select members of the Cluster are firm indications of
              corporate America&#39;s respect for FAMU&#39;s educational
              leadership and graduates of its academic programs. From 1989 to
              2000 FAMU provided 873 Life-Gets-Better Scholarships to
              outstanding minority students majoring in such disciplines as
              Engineering, Physical, Life, Natural, and Computer Sciences and
              Pre-Law.
            </p>

              The Dr. Frederick S. Humphries STEAM Portal provides BIPOC
              students with global access to the local knowledge of the world.
              This academic infrastructure puts both HBCUs and researches
              directly in touch with BIPOC students from Southern CA and beyond.
              Like a library, portals are a resource for faculty that opens new
              modes of research, learning, and study.
