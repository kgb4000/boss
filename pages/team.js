                <h3>Everett L. Glenn</h3>
                <i>CEO and Executive Director</i>
              </div>
              <p>
                A graduate of Oberlin College and Case-Western Reserve
                University’s School of Law, Everett is a member of the State Bar
                of Ohio and the State Bar of California.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett has extensive legal experience in commercial, corporate
                and real estate transactions, and has consistently demonstrated
                an effectiveness at handling complex projects and responding to
                client needs under time constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett is an accomplished negotiator with a record of
                developing creative solutions to complex business and legal
                problems. Before establishing the Institute, Everett was a
                principal at Entertainment & Sports Plus (“ESP”), a Southern
                California based athlete management firm that represented
                professional athletes, entertainers, entertainment companies and
                related talent in contract negotiations and provided advice and
                counsel on financial, personal development and marketing
                matters.
              </p>
              <p>
                For over 20 years, Everett was a NFL and NBA certified contract
                advisor, whose clients included 13 first round draft picks in
                the NBA and NFL and 3 inductees into the NFL Hall of Fame.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett was the first Black attorney/agent to represent multiple
                1st round draft picks in the same NFL draft (twice); first and
                perhaps still the only attorney/agent to represent 1st round
                draft picks in both the NBA and the NFL in the same year
                (twice); 1st round draft picks in 5 straight NFL drafts; and 1st
                round wide receivers in 4 straight NFL drafts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett’s list of “firsts” also includes becoming the first
                Black attorney in the Office of the City Attorney for the City
                of Long Beach, where he took the lead on ensuring compliance by
                developers with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
                (HUD) Act of 1968 on over $150 million in affordable housing
                projects and authored the Small Business Enterprise Program for
                the Port of Long Beach, the nation’s busiest port, to promote
                participation of small and very small business concerns in Port
                spending.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enacted in 2006, the program resulted in the award of over $300
                million in construction and planning contracts for small and
                very small businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett got his legal start at Guren, Merritt, Sogg & Cohen in
                Cleveland, OH in 1977 working under James Bailey, the attorney
                for former Cleveland Browns (now Baltimore Ravens) owner, Art
                Modell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett relocated to San Francisco in 1980 and, after a 3-year
                stint as District Counsel for the U.S. Small Business
                Administration, joined Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe which
                was one of the 100 largest law firms in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                During his career Everett also served as a Senior Attorney with
                the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency established
                to manage the disposition of over $195 billion in S & L assets,
                Everett developed the strategy for terminating letters of credit
                in 76 mixed-housing, commercial and retail bond-financed
                projects, in connection with the winding up of the affairs of
                the receiverships for 16 thrifts, enabling the government to
                avoid $628 million in funding obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everett serves in an Of Counsel capacity to Alvarado Smith, LLP,
                the largest minority-owned law firm in California.
